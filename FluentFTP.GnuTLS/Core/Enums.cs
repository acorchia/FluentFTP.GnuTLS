	/**
	* gnutls_init_flags_t:
	*
	* @GNUTLS_SERVER: Connection end is a server.
	* @GNUTLS_CLIENT: Connection end is a client.
	* @GNUTLS_DATAGRAM: Connection is datagram oriented (DTLS). Since 3.0.0.
	* @GNUTLS_NONBLOCK: Connection should not block. Since 3.0.0.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL: In systems where SIGPIPE is delivered on send, it will be disabled. That flag has effect in systems which support the MSG_NOSIGNAL sockets flag (since 3.4.2).
	* @GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS: Do not enable any TLS extensions by default (since 3.1.2). As TLS 1.2 and later require extensions this option is considered obsolete and should not be used.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION: Disable any replay protection in DTLS. This must only be used if  replay protection is achieved using other means. Since 3.2.2.
	* @GNUTLS_ALLOW_ID_CHANGE: Allow the peer to replace its certificate, or change its ID during a rehandshake. This change is often used in attacks and thus prohibited by default. Since 3.5.0.
	* @GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START: Enable the TLS false start on client side if the negotiated ciphersuites allow it. This will enable sending data prior to the handshake being complete, and may introduce a risk of crypto failure when combined with certain key exchanged; for that GnuTLS may not enable that option in ciphersuites that are known to be not safe for false start. Since 3.5.0.
	* @GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START: Under TLS1.3 allow the server to return earlier than the full handshake
	*   finish; similarly to false start the handshake will be completed once data are received by the
	*   client, while the server is able to transmit sooner. This is not enabled by default as it could
	*   break certain existing server assumptions and use-cases. Since 3.6.4.
	* @GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_DATA: Under TLS1.3 allow the server to receive early data sent as part of the initial ClientHello (0-RTT).
	*   This can also be used to explicitly indicate that the client will send early data.
	*   This is not enabled by default as early data has weaker security properties than other data. Since 3.6.5.
	* @GNUTLS_FORCE_CLIENT_CERT: When in client side and only a single cert is specified, send that certificate irrespective of the issuers expected by the server. Since 3.5.0.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_TICKETS: Flag to indicate that the session should not use resumption with session tickets.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_TICKETS_TLS12: Flag to indicate that the session should not use resumption with session tickets. This flag only has effect if TLS 1.2 is used.
	* @GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP3: Generate key shares for the top-3 different groups which are enabled.
	*   That is, as each group is associated with a key type (EC, finite field, x25519), generate
	*   three keys using %GNUTLS_PK_DH, %GNUTLS_PK_EC, %GNUTLS_PK_ECDH_X25519 if all of them are enabled.
	* @GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP2: Generate key shares for the top-2 different groups which are enabled.
	*   For example (ECDH + x25519). This is the default.
	* @GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP: Generate key share for the first group which is enabled.
	*   For example x25519. This option is the most performant for client (less CPU spent
	*   generating keys), but if the server doesn't support the advertized option it may
	*   result to more roundtrips needed to discover the server's choice.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_AUTO_REKEY: Disable auto-rekeying under TLS1.3. If this option is not specified
	*   gnutls will force a rekey after 2^24 records have been sent.
	* @GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH: Enable post handshake authentication for server and client. When set and
	*   a server requests authentication after handshake %GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST will be returned
	*   by gnutls_record_recv(). A client should then call gnutls_reauth() to re-authenticate.
	* @GNUTLS_SAFE_PADDING_CHECK: Flag to indicate that the TLS 1.3 padding check will be done in a
	*   safe way which doesn't leak the pad size based on GnuTLS processing time. This is of use to
	*   applications which hide the length of transferred data via the TLS1.3 padding mechanism and
	*   are already taking steps to hide the data processing time. This comes at a performance
	*   penalty.
	* @GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH: Enable transparent re-authentication in client side when the server
	*    requests to. That is, reauthentication is handled within gnutls_record_recv(), and
	*    the %GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE or %GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST are not returned. This must be
	*    enabled with %GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH for TLS1.3. Enabling this flag requires to restore
	*    interrupted calls to gnutls_record_recv() based on the output of gnutls_record_get_direction(),
	*    since gnutls_record_recv() could be interrupted when sending when this flag is enabled.
	*    Note this flag may not be used if you are using the same session for sending and receiving
	*    in different threads.
	* @GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK: Allows raw public-keys to be negotiated during the handshake. Since 3.6.6.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_AUTO_SEND_TICKET: Under TLS1.3 disable auto-sending of
	*    session tickets during the handshake.
	* @GNUTLS_NO_END_OF_EARLY_DATA: Under TLS1.3 suppress sending EndOfEarlyData message. Since 3.7.2.
	*
	* Enumeration of different flags for gnutls_init() function. All the flags
	* can be combined except @GNUTLS_SERVER and @GNUTLS_CLIENT which are mutually
	* exclusive.
	*
	* The key share options relate to the TLS 1.3 key share extension
	* which is a speculative key generation expecting that the server
	* would support the generated key.

	 *   certificates that have version 1.  This option is to be used
	 *   to deprecate all certificates of version 1.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_SAME: If a certificate is not signed by
	 *   anyone trusted but exists in the trusted CA list do not treat it
	 *   as trusted.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN: A certificate chain is tolerated
	 *   if unsorted (the case with many TLS servers out there). This is the
	 *   default since GnuTLS 3.1.4.

	 *   dangerous since those haven't the basicConstraints
	 *   extension.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2: Allow certificates to be signed
	 *   using the broken MD2 algorithm.

	 *   and expiration validity periods of certificate chains. Don't set
	 *   this unless you understand the security implications.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CRL_CHECKS: Disable checking for validity
	 *   using certificate revocation lists or the available OCSP data.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_WILDCARDS: When including a hostname
	 *   check in the verification, do not consider any wildcards.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_IP_MATCHES: When verifying a hostname
	 *   prevent textual IP addresses from matching IP addresses in the
	 *   certificate. Treat the input only as a DNS name.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_USE_TLS1_RSA: This indicates that a (raw) RSA signature is provided
	 *   as in the TLS 1.0 protocol. Not all functions accept this flag.
	 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CRIT_EXTENSIONS: This signals the verification
	 *   process, not to fail on unknown critical extensions.
